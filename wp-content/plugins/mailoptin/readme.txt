= Intuitive Form & Template Builder =

You don't have to be a designer or hire one to build high converting optin forms. Our powerful drag & drop builder allows you to create conversion-optimized forms and email newsletter templates.

### Features of MailOptin Premium

= Automated Newsletters =

MailOptin integrates WordPress with all major email marketing providers to send automated newsletters and event-triggered emails. This can be very useful if your email marketing service lacks such.

For example, **Sendy** is a newsletter application without integration with WordPress to send *new publish post notifications* to an email list. MailOptin bridges this gap and delivers your post content immediately they are published.

Use MailOptin today to deliver new post notification and email digest newsletters to your email list at Mailchimp, Constant Contact, Campaign Monitor, Klaviyo, ActiveCampaign, Infusionsoft, Sendinblue, SendGrid, Mailjet etc.

= A/B Testing: Take out the guesswork =

Marketers are constantly using trial and error to guess what will be most effective — but they shouldn't have to. A/B content testing lets you see what optin campaign will be most effective before you share it with your larger audience. No more guesswork.

MailOptin ships with an easy built-in A/B testing feature that enables you to make data-driven decisions that will improve your conversions and revenue for any optin campaign. [Learn more](https://mailoptin.io/ab-testing-wordpress/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion)

= More highly converting optin types =

There are cases where you would find popups, sidebar and in-post optin forms an inappropriate solution. That is why we offer different optin form types such as [notification bars](https://mailoptin.io/notification-bar/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) and [slide-ins](https://mailoptin.io/slide-in/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) so you don’t have to rely on one way of collecting leads and install multiple software and platforms to achieve them.

= Conversion Boosting Optin Display Rules & Triggers =

Timing is everything. This is why MailOptin continually tracks visitors interaction on your website and display the right message or optin form at the right time they are likely to convert.

Our [Exit Intent](https://mailoptin.io/demos/exit-intent/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) and [slide-ins](https://mailoptin.io/slide-in/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) trigger convert abandoning visitors into subscribers by your optin campaign at the precise moment they are about leaving your website.

If your opt-in form displays too early, your reader might not yet be willing to subscribe and waiting too long will make you lose out on new leads. Our [Pageviews](https://mailoptin.io/demos/pageviews/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) and [Time on Site](https://mailoptin.io/demos/time-on-site/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) triggers give you fine-grained control over the display of your optin campaigns.

The [Scroll Trigger](https://mailoptin.io/demos/scroll-trigger/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) display optin forms or messages only after a visitor scrolls a down a specific percentage of your page.

The [Click Launch Trigger](https://mailoptin.io/click-launch/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) display optin forms when a link, button or image on your site is clicked. Useful for implementing content upgrades.

[AdBlock Detection](https://mailoptin.io/adblock-detection-wordpress/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) helps you detect users using AdBlocking software such as AdBlock Plus, uBlock Origin so you can display another content to them.

The [Referrer Detection](https://mailoptin.io/referrer-detection/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) can automatically track sources of web traffic and create optin forms, call to actions and custom messages targeted from a specific traffic source.

The [Device Targeting](https://mailoptin.io/device-targeting-wordpress/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) allows you to target your optins to desktop, mobile and tablet users for a better user experience and increased conversion.
